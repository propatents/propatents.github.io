<h1>Case for patents</h1>

<h3>1. Encourages innovation</h3>

Intellectual Ventures found the perfect way to determine whether patents encourage innovation or
not. Their proposed method to determine this is to ask the big S&amp;P companies whether their
executives think this is a good idea or not. It turns out that 70% of the chief executives believe
that patents are good for innovation.<sup><a href="#n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

<p>
<img src="img/good-for-innovation.jpg" alt="patents are good for innovation"/>
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the hunches of these executives is correct. There's clear evidence that without
patents innovation comes to a halt. As an example let's look at the software patents. The
software patents became legal in 1981.<sup><a href="#n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> One picture is worth
thousand words. Have a look how much boost has this given to the evolution of the GUIs since that
year (make sure to note the year of the screenshot to infer the speed of innovation):
<sup><a href="#n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/gui.png" alt="evolution of guis"/>
</p>

<p>
There are some niche domains where the companies don't use the patent system to encourage the
innovation in their area and thus its innovation rate is abysmal. For an example let's look at the
pornographic industry. If you issue a Google Patent Search with the keyword "pornography" you get
only about 46 400 results.<sup><a href="#n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> This number suggest a very low
innovation rate compared to other industries.<sup><a href="#n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> This is a quite
reliable metric, just look how sluggish the innovation was in the porn industry:
<sup><a href="#n6" id="r6">6</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>had online payment systems since the 1990s
	<sup><a href="#n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>had working video streaming since early 2000s
	<sup><a href="#n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>managed to increase people's need for higher bandwidth
	<sup><a href="#n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>2. Enriches the innovator</h3>

<p>
Do you think Bill Gates would have managed to accumulate so much wealth and build so big monopoly as
he did without our beloved patents? Just hear his opinion about them from 1991:
<sup><a href="#n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were
	invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today. I
	feel certain that some large company will patent some obvious thing related to interface,
	object orientation, algorithm, application extension or other crucial technique. If we
	assume this company has no need of any of our patents then they have a 17-year right to take
	as much of our profits as they want. The solution to this is patent exchanges with large
	companies and patenting as much as we can.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<img src="img/big-companies.png" alt="logos of big companies"/>
</p>

<p>
Innovation is a hard procedure and so the patent system rewards the innovators with all the riches.
With lots of money the company can buy lots advertising to force the wannabe imitators out of media
focus and also with loads of money makes it possible for lobby the politicians for the better future
for all of us (the innovators are smart people after all). With lobbying they don't only improve
laws to make sure the bastard imitators can't enter the
industry<sup><a href="#n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> but every well spent dollar on lobbying returns
sometimes even up to $220.<sup><a href="#n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> And how much money is spent on
lobbying you ask? Here are some stats: <sup><a href="#n14" id="r14">14</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/lobbying.png" alt="the lobbying efforts"/>
</p>

<p>
What would happen without patents? There would be lots of smaller companies all struggling with
competition and they wouldn't have any other option other than spend their all their money on
innovation.<sup><a href="#n15" id="r15">15</a></sup> And every innovation would be public domain so
the shady imitators wouldn't even need to spend money on R&amp;D, as expertise will be public for
anyone to grab. Just look how well everybody automatically understands the intricacies of the Linux
kernel just because it is open source.
</p>

<p>
And not only that but not many companies could grow large. If nobody has access to a large share of
a nation's wealth then that means the wealth is well distributed. That is clearly a sign of an
economic situation gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
And how would a poor inventor get some returns on his invention if not from patents? Just look how
complicated process the steam engine engineers followed after Watt's patent for the steam engine
expired: <sup><a href="#n16" id="r16">16</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Because of uncertainty in coal mining, a modest number of investors engaged in mutual
	insurance by each owning shares in a broad cross-section of mines. As is the case with
	shareholders in publicly traded companies, this means that each investor was able to capture
	the benefit of innovation, regardless of which particular firm or engineer made the
	improvement. And indeed, the employment contracts of engineers reflected these incentives.
	Engineers were employed on a contract basis by particular mines to improve engines, with the
	understanding that they would publish their results. Investors captured the common gains to
	all mines from each innovation, while engineers, having signed away the right to monopolize
	their invention, profited instead from their fees and by the advertising value of
	publicizing their innovations.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3. Motivates the innovator</h3>

<p>
mention: the inventor of the internet and the midi inventor
</p>

<p>
Without the patent system no sane inventor would have any motivation to innovate. In the reality
though you can find some insane people who decided not to patent their inventions.
</p>

<p>
For example Tim Berners-Lee decided not to patent his creation the World Wide Web. Now imagine how
better off would every one be when every time you access a website you would need to pay one cent to
Tim. Tim would be much richer, there would much more websites and the whole world wide web would be
much more innovative. What a wasted oppurtinity!
</p>

<p>
https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110811/10245715476/what-if-tim-berners-lee-had-patented-web.shtml
http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/11/one-of-techs-most-successful-inventors-never-made-a-cent/
</p>

<p>
Or for another example look at Dave Smith the inventor of the well known MIDI. This technology used
in many areas of the sound/music industry ranging from various electronic instrument communications
to playing back ringing tones on your ancient phones. This technology is so widely used that if he
would have patented it he would be a billionaire. His reason for not patenting? "We wanted to be
sure we had 100% participation, so we decided not to charge any other companies that wanted to use
it." What an idiot!
</p>

<h3>4. Patents defend innovative ideas</h3>

<p>
<img src="img/one-click-buy.png" alt="the secret of one click buy"/>
</p>

<p>
For innovative ideas like Amazon's one click buy invention
<sup><a href="#n19" id="r19">19</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n20" id="r20">20</a></sup> which pushes
the envelope of the technology the only way to retain its innovative value is to use the patent
system. But there are many more innovative ideas which need a defense by laws, here's a
sampling: <sup><a href="#n21" id="r21">21</a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>U.S. Patent 6080436: toasting bread in a toaster operating between 2500 and 4500 degrees.
	<sup><a href="#n22" id="r22">22</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>U.S. Patent 6004596: the sealed crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
	<sup><a href="#n23" id="r23">23</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li> U.S. Patent 5616089: a "putting method in which the golfer controls the speed of the
	putt and the direction of the putt primarily with the golfer's dominant throwing hand, yet
	uses the golfer's nondominant hand to maintain the blade of the putter stable."
	<sup><a href="#n24" id="r24">24</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>U.S. Patent 6368227: "A method of swing on a swing is disclosed, in which a user
	positioned on a standard swing suspended by two chains from a substantially horizontal tree
	branch induces side to side motion by pulling alternately on one chain and then the other."
	<sup><a href="#n25" id="r25">25</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>U.S. Patent 6293874: "User-operated amusement apparatus for kicking the user's buttocks"
	<sup><a href="#n26" id="r26">26</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="img/spacex.jpg" alt="a spacex invention"/>
</p>

<p>
Silly and obvious inventions like SpaceX's rockets are not
patented<sup><a href="#n28" id="r28">28</a></sup>, people don't even bother with them.
Because of this SpaceX will soon go bankrupt after the imitators start to copy their inventions,
as every other company which has not patented its ideas, like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>TravelPro, the inventor of Rollaboard, "a vertical bag with two wheels and an extendable
	handle that one could roll through airports and carry on airplanes".
	<sup><a href="#n29" id="r29">29</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>Ferrero, the owner of the Nutella hazelnut chocolate spread.
	<sup><a href="#n30" id="r30">30</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>Pepsi, the first company with light-weight, recyclable, plastic bottles.
	<sup><a href="#n31" id="r31">31</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n32" id="r32">32</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Patents are cheap</h3>

<p>
todo: report the number of lawsuits and the cost it imposed on the various industries

<h3>6. The patent system creates jobs</h3>

There was a time period where one could not patent life forms. Full patent protection for various
plants appeared in 1970.<sup><a href="#n17" id="r17">17</a></sup> Before that there was no motivation for
experimenting on life forms, there were no new breeds developed, we just got whatever nature has
given us for free. Now that we have patent protection we actively need to defend the proprietary breeds.
In order to do this it is illegal to save seeds.<sup><a href="#n18" id="r18">18</a></sup>

"At its inception, the dye industry was a French-British business the same way that almost any
industry was a French- British business until the second half of the nineteenth century. In both
countries patent protection applied to all kinds of industrial products. In 1862 British firms
controlled about 50% of the world market, and French firms another 40%, Swiss and German companies
being marginal players. By 1873 German companies had 50% of the market, while French, Swiss and
British firms controlled between 13% and 17% each. In 1913 German firms had a market share of more
than 80%, the Swiss had about 8%, and firms in the rest of the world had largely disappeared. During
this entire period there was no patent protection at all in Switzerland, while in Germany processes
become patentable in 1877 but products did not. In France, the U.K. and the U.S. both products and
processes had been patentable all along.", Against Intellectual Monopoly, Chapter 9, section
