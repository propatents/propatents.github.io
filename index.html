<h1>Case for patents</h1>

<h3>1. Encourages innovation</h3>

Intellectual Ventures found the perfect way to determine whether patents encourage innovation or
not. Their proposed method to determine this is to ask the big S&amp;P companies whether their
executives think this is a good idea or not. It turns out that 70% of the chief executives believe
that patents are good for innovation.<sup><a href="#n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

<p>
<img src="img/good-for-innovation.jpg" alt="patents are good for innovation"/>
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the hunches of these executives is correct. There's clear evidence that without
patents innovation comes to a halt. As an example let's look at the software patents. The
software patents became legal in 1981.<sup><a href="#n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> One picture is worth
thousand words. Have a look how much boost has this given to the evolution of the GUIs since that
year (make sure to note the year of the screenshot to infer the speed of innovation):
<sup><a href="#n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/gui.png" alt="evolution of guis"/>
</p>

<p>
There are some niche domains where the companies don't use the patent system to encourage the
innovation in their area and thus its innovation rate is abysmal. For an example let's look at the
pornographic industry. If you issue a Google Patent Search with the keyword "pornography" you get
only about 46 400 results.<sup><a href="#n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> This number suggest a very low
innovation rate compared to other industries.<sup><a href="#n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> This is a quite
reliable metric, just look how sluggish the innovation was in the porn industry:
<sup><a href="#n6" id="r6">6</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>had online payment systems since the 1990s
	<sup><a href="#n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>had working video streaming since early 2000s
	<sup><a href="#n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>managed to increase people's need for higher bandwidth
	<sup><a href="#n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Enriches the innovator</h3>

<p>
Do you think Bill Gates would have managed to accumulate so much wealth and build so big monopoly as
he did without our beloved patents? Just hear his opinion about them from 1991:
<sup><a href="#n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were
	invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today. I
	feel certain that some large company will patent some obvious thing related to interface,
	object orientation, algorithm, application extension or other crucial technique. If we
	assume this company has no need of any of our patents then they have a 17-year right to take
	as much of our profits as they want. The solution to this is patent exchanges with large
	companies and patenting as much as we can.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<img src="img/big-companies.png" alt="logos of big companies"/>
</p>

<p>
Innovation is a hard procedure and so the patent system rewards the innovators with all the riches.
With lots of money the company can buy lots advertising to force the wannabe imitators out of media
focus and also with loads of money makes it possible for lobby the politicians for the better future
for all of us (the innovators are smart people after all). With lobbying they don't only improve
laws to make sure the bastard imitators can't enter the
industry<sup><a href="#n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> but every well spent dollar on lobbying returns
sometimes even up to $220.<sup><a href="#n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> And how much money is spent on
lobbying you ask? Here are some stats: <sup><a href="#n14" id="r14">14</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/lobbying.png" alt="the lobbying efforts"/>
</p>

<p>
What would happen without patents? There would be lots of smaller companies all struggling with
competition and they wouldn't have any other option other than spend their all their money on
innovation.<sup><a href="#n15" id="r15">15</a></sup> And every innovation would be public domain so
the shady imitators wouldn't even need to spend money on R&amp;D, as expertise will be public for
anyone to grab. Just look how well you and everybody else automatically understand the intricacies
of the Linux kernel just because it is open source.
</p>

<p>
And not only that but not many companies could grow large. If nobody has access to a large share of
a nation's wealth then that means the wealth is well distributed. That is clearly a sign of an
economic situation gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
And how would a poor inventor get some returns on his invention if not from patents? Just look how
complicated process the steam engine engineers followed after Watt's patent for the steam engine
expired: <sup><a href="#n16" id="r16">16</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Because of uncertainty in coal mining, a modest number of investors engaged in mutual
	insurance by each owning shares in a broad cross-section of mines. As is the case with
	shareholders in publicly traded companies, this means that each investor was able to capture
	the benefit of innovation, regardless of which particular firm or engineer made the
	improvement. And indeed, the employment contracts of engineers reflected these incentives.
	Engineers were employed on a contract basis by particular mines to improve engines, with the
	understanding that they would publish their results. Investors captured the common gains to
	all mines from each innovation, while engineers, having signed away the right to monopolize
	their invention, profited instead from their fees and by the advertising value of
	publicizing their innovations.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3. Motivates the innovator</h3>

<p>
Every innovation is product of a long and hard work.<sup><a href="#n17" id="r17">17</a></sup>
This is why you can't find instances when two independent people invent the same thing
independently.<sup><a href="#n18" id="r18">18</a></sup>
Without the patent system no sane inventor would have any motivation to innovate. In the reality
though you can find some insane people who decided not to patent their inventions.
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/unmotivated.png" alt="some random unmotivated dudes"/>
</p>

<p>
For example Tim Berners-Lee (left picture) decided not to patent his creation the World Wide Web.
Now imagine how better off would every one be when every time you accessed a website you would need
to pay one cent to Tim. Tim would be much richer, there would much more websites and the whole world
wide web would be much more innovative. Maybe the dot-com bubble would be still growing! What a
wasted opportunity!
<sup><a href="#n19" id="r19">19</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Or for another example look at Dave Smith (right picture), the inventor of the well known MIDI. This
technology used in many areas of the sound/music industry ranging from various electronic instrument
communication protocols to playing back ringing tones on your ancient phones. This technology is so
widely used that if he would have patented it he would be a billionaire. His reason for not
patenting? "We wanted to be sure we had 100% participation, so we decided not to charge any other
companies that wanted to use it." What a narrow world view! <sup><a href="#n20" id="r20">20</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>4. Patents defend innovative ideas</h3>

<p>
<img src="img/one-click-buy.png" alt="the secret of one click buy"/>
</p>

<p>
For innovative ideas like Amazon's one click buy invention
<sup><a href="#n21" id="r21">21</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n22" id="r22">22</a></sup> which pushes
the envelope of the technology the only way to retain its innovative value is to use the patent
system. But there are many more innovative ideas which need a defense by laws, here's a
sampling: <sup><a href="#n23" id="r23">23</a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>U.S. Patent 6080436: toasting bread in a toaster operating between 2500 and 4500 degrees.
	<sup><a href="#n24" id="r24">24</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>U.S. Patent 6004596: the sealed crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
	<sup><a href="#n25" id="r25">25</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li> U.S. Patent 5616089: a "putting method in which the golfer controls the speed of the
	putt and the direction of the putt primarily with the golfer's dominant throwing hand, yet
	uses the golfer's nondominant hand to maintain the blade of the putter stable."
	<sup><a href="#n26" id="r26">26</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>U.S. Patent 6368227: "A method of swing on a swing is disclosed, in which a user
	positioned on a standard swing suspended by two chains from a substantially horizontal tree
	branch induces side to side motion by pulling alternately on one chain and then the other."
	<sup><a href="#n27" id="r27">27</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>U.S. Patent 6293874: "User-operated amusement apparatus for kicking the user's buttocks"
	<sup><a href="#n28" id="r28">28</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="img/spacex.jpg" alt="a spacex invention"/>
</p>

<p>
Silly and obvious inventions like SpaceX's rockets are not
patented<sup><a href="#n30" id="r30">30</a></sup>, people don't even bother with them.
Because of this SpaceX will soon go bankrupt after the imitators start to copy their inventions,
as every other company which has not patented its ideas, like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>TravelPro, the inventor of Rollaboard, "a vertical bag with two wheels and an extendable
	handle that one could roll through airports and carry on airplanes".
	<sup><a href="#n31" id="r31">31</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>Ferrero, the owner of the Nutella hazelnut chocolate spread.
	<sup><a href="#n32" id="r32">32</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>Pepsi, the first company with light-weight, recyclable, plastic bottles.
	<sup><a href="#n33" id="r33">33</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n34" id="r34">34</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. The patent system creates jobs</h3>

As you may know the patent system is a multibillion-dollar industry. Just in 2011 the
non-creating-just-thinking U.S. innovators created a $29 billion dollars cost to the leeching
imitators.<sup><a href="#n35" id="r35">35</a></sup> Do you know how many patent attorney jobs this
creates instead of spending that money on hardworking craftsmen? You can find startups which
consist of 5 employees but also need the services of 6 lawyers focused on patent
issues.<sup><a href="#n36" id="r36">36</a></sup> Being a patent attorney is an important service to
the society and thus we reward it with $100,000+ first year
income.<sup><a href="#n37" id="r37">37</a></sup>

<p>
<img src="img/uspto.jpg" alt="uspto logo"/>
</p>

<p>
And we haven't even talked about the USPTO spendings of $3 billions of our tax dollars just to keep
our beloved patent office working.<sup><a href="#n38" id="r38">38</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>6. The pharmaceutical industry cannot exists without patents</h3>

<p>
According a survey of medical doctors these fifteen inventions are the most important inventions of
the medical industry:<sup><a href="#n39" id="r39">39</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Penicillin, x rays, tissue culture, ether (anaesthetic), chlorpromazine, public sanitation,
	germ theory, evidence based medicine, vaccines, the pill, computers, oral rehydration
	therapy, DNA structure, monoclonal antibody technology, smoking health risk.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Most of these inventions are patented. More precisely only the
chlorpromazine<sup><a href="#n40" id="r40">40</a></sup> and the
pill<sup><a href="#n41" id="r41">41</a></sup> are patented. The remaining boring inventions usually
come from biotech companies and universities.<sup><a href="#n42" id="r42">42</a></sup> Can you
imagine how much sicker we would be if all these patented inventions had not been available to us
because the innovators hadn't had the motivation to invent them? And how much more people would have
avoided polio if the polio vaccine had been patented by its inventor, Jonas
Salk?<sup><a href="#n43" id="r43">43</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
There is just no question whether patents improve medicine or not, just look at this
report:<sup><a href="#n44" id="r44">44</a></sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Research by Sandy Weisburst and mentored by [Scherer] showed, for example, that Italy, with
	a vibrant generic drug industry, did not achieve any significant increase in the discovery
	of innovative drugs during the first decade after the Italian Supreme Court mandated the
	issue of pharmaceutical product patents.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<img src="img/pharma-patents.jpg" alt="random clipart about pharma's patent wars stolen from random
website"/>
</p>

<p>
All of this researching of new drugs cost a lot of money<sup><a href="#n45" id="r45">45</a></sup>
so the whole pharma industry is heavily subsidized<sup><a href="#n46" id="r46">46</a></sup>
and receives quite hefty portions of your well earned
dollars.<sup><a href="#n47" id="r47">47</a></sup> Then most of the pharma industry's income is spent
on advertisement.<sup><a href="#n48" id="r48">48</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#n49" id="r49">49</a></sup>
The little remaining money is spent on R&amp;D of which 60 percent is spent on development of
"me-too" drugs of other companies to stay in business but with different recipe to avoid patenting
issues.<sup><a href="#n50" id="r50">50</a></sup> How is this not useful for the society? How could
it even work without patents? Are we gonna give away expensive Nobel prizes for useful innovations
or what? <sup><a href="#n51" id="r51">51</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>7. Patent laws improve over time</h3>

<p>
Without all the regulations most people in the United States of America would be clueless - they
wouldn't know what to do with themselves! So this means we need lot of regulations (also known as
central planning). Even small regulations can improve the economy by great lengths. For an example
just look at Massachusetts Route 128.<sup><a href="#n52" id="r52">52</a></sup> The well known Route
128 was a place where the boys and girls from Harvard and MIT went to work in or start their own
companies. It was one of the America's most innovative areas in the technology/computer industries.
It also had regulations against job hopping so if somebody left/was fired from a company then he/she
couldn't go to/start a different company in the same tech
sector.<sup><a href="#n53" id="r53">53</a></sup> Other areas like Silicon Valley (of which you've
probably never heard) had no such restrictions and look how the place rotted away just to become
another deserted place on Earth.<sup><a href="#n54" id="r54">54</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
This demonstrates that our US government knows what's best for us and that is more regulations. The
patent laws had a slow start but fortunately they are catching
up: <sup><a href="#n55" id="r55">55</a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>1790 - the first US patent
	</li>

	<li>1842 - fabric patents
	</li>

	<li>1880 - no need for patent models
	</li>

	<li>1930 - the first plant patents
	</li>

	<li>1954 - more plant patents
	</li>

	<li>1970 - plant variety protection act
	</li>

	<li>1981 - gene patents
	</li>

	<li>1981 - software patents
	</li>

	<li>1998 - financial instrument patents
	</li>

	<li>2013 - switch to first to file ruling
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately still over 90% of the most innovative products from the past few decades were not
patented.<sup><a href="#n56" id="r56">56</a></sup> This means one thing only: we need more patent
regulations! Here are some examples which are currently under consideration by the general public:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>algorithms
	<sup><a href="#n57" id="r57">57</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>story plots
	<sup><a href="#n58" id="r58">58</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>sport moves
	<sup><a href="#n59" id="r59">59</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>human genes
	<sup><a href="#n60" id="r60">60</a></sup>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
So clearly there are no downsides to patents. Some people still would rather have no patents at all.
These people want to live in a world without patents, where there's no technology, everything is
freely copied, people have to work a lot, and everybody is sick because nobody can cure us.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Isn't a technocratic world better where our rights are defended, have high tech toys, and don't need
to live a healthy life because the corporations can cure us from any problems?
</p>

<p>

<p>
So take action! Call your representative and ask him for stronger patent laws!

"At its inception, the dye industry was a French-British business the same way that almost any
industry was a French- British business until the second half of the nineteenth century. In both
countries patent protection applied to all kinds of industrial products. In 1862 British firms
controlled about 50% of the world market, and French firms another 40%, Swiss and German companies
being marginal players. By 1873 German companies had 50% of the market, while French, Swiss and
British firms controlled between 13% and 17% each. In 1913 German firms had a market share of more
than 80%, the Swiss had about 8%, and firms in the rest of the world had largely disappeared. During
this entire period there was no patent protection at all in Switzerland, while in Germany processes
become patentable in 1877 but products did not. In France, the U.K. and the U.S. both products and
processes had been patentable all along.", Against Intellectual Monopoly, Chapter 9, section
